Short-Range LiDAR Detection System Using Raspberry Pi and Arduino Integration

This project aimed to create a compact, short-range LiDAR detection system for real-time obstacle detection using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino Uno, and a servo-mounted LiDAR sensor. 
The system was built to demonstrate low-cost proximity scanning by rotating the sensor with a servo motor and transmitting distance data to the Pi for visualization and logging.

The project used a polar scanning model to collect 180-degree sweep data in front of the device, with the Arduino handling servo control and time-of-flight measurements. 
Data was processed by the Raspberry Pi using Python, where simple statistical thresholds and visual feedback were used to evaluate detection accuracy. 
Basic tests against known distances showed the system was accurate within Â±2 cm for targets under 2 meters.

This project demonstrated the feasibility of a DIY LiDAR scanner using affordable components. 
Future improvements include integrating real-time plotting, adding object classification, and expanding the sweep range for full 360-degree coverage. 
Upgrading the LiDAR module to improve resolution and extending wireless communication capabilities could also enhance deployment in robotics and automation contexts.
